## Description
FitNotes is an app which allows users to save and track their workout results. 
In order to create a new workout users can either type in exercise name or choose from previously saved ones. If existing exercise got selected, the most recent exercise results appear so user can easily learn where they left off.

Technologies used:
* Firebase: for storing workout data and authentication;
* MVVM pattern;
* Unit testing
* SwiftLint

Currently working on:
Authentication, userâ€™s progress and workout statistics, onboarding
